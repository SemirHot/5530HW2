<h1>Part 1</h1>
I started out by taking out all the NA values from the dataset, i was trying to come up with a formula to get an accurate price that i can replace the NA value with but there are too many factors to take
into account when trying to get the value that was missing for us such as condition, availability of that specific car in the area, maintenance records, and so on, If i were to assume those said factors listed 
i could be mistaking the value by a large margin and making the data set not lose the integrity of it. I did all that and then i saved it into cleaneddata.csv, if you want to take a look at it it will be under the data folder above.
